# Football-Player-Calc

This Python program allows users to enter data for a Lineman, Quarterback, and Running-back, and then calculates and displays various game statistics such as Quarterback Rating (QBR). The program uses object-oriented programming concepts and demonstrates inheritance and polymorphism. The repository contains the source code, as well as documentation and examples of how to use the program.

 # Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed on your system

# Installation

Download the source code for the program from a repository or a source code archive.
Extract the contents of the archive to a folder of your choice.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where the source code is located.

# Running the program

In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command to start the program:
 python main.py

Follow the prompts to enter data for the Lineman, Quarterback, and Running-back. The program will ask for various game statistics such as passes attempted and completed, yards, touchdowns, and interceptions.

Once you have entered data for all three players, the program will calculate and display various game statistics, such as the Quarterback Rating (QBR), for the Quarterback player.

After the program has finished running, you can exit the program by closing the terminal or command prompt.

That's it! If you have any issues or questions, please consult the program documentation or reach out to the program maintainers.
